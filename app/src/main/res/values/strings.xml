Afterwards there had been some changes in his perspective and he decided to quit his game experience in 2019. He moved on to C# where he was trying to create an English words trainer and had a success in it. Later on Vadym migrated to Java when he decided to attend the courses in 2021 and 2022. He had discovered Android for himself there.</string>
